                <h3>About Me</h3>

                <dd>
                    <p>"Hello there", I'm Oluwaseitan Seyitan, currently enrolled at Altschool pursuing a degree in software engineering, specifically focusing on Cloud engineering. My student identification is ALT/SOE/023/2307. I'm excited to share my experience at Altschool, my inspirations, and the goals I aim to accomplish during my time here.<br>

                        I graduated from university in 2021, studied History and international studies but I'm here pursuing a tech career because the world evolves. I'm a football fan and love anything sports. I,m quite fun and jovial but I'm really not all serious minded and i hope tht through my experience with Altschool I'll see life in a new light and have a more purpose to do better than I am  currently.

                        I enrolled in Altschool because of the endless possibilities it offers in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape. Altschool, with its reputation for fostering innovation, creativity, and a hands-on approach to learning, seemed like the perfect place for me to develop skills and knowledge in this field to make ends meet and affect the world in a positive way through my acquired skills.</p>

                <h3>My Altschool Journey</h3>

                <dd>

                    <p>My journey in Altschool has been an exciting one, even though it started a litte difficult, i've been able to get a hang of it little by little through the help of my lecturers(Setemi, Maye, and Rising) and my colleagues. It has been a really challenging journey for me because prior to starting this tech journey with Altschool, i had no background on anything tech-related but the remote learning environment is of big advantage, allowing me to balance my studies with other commitments. I've had the privilege of learning from great minds in the software engineering world through online lectures, and engaging discussions. Altschool's emphasis on real-world projects has given me the opportunity to apply what I've learned to practical situations, and I've been fortunate to collaborate with amazing mates from Altschool through slack and github as well.

                    <p>My  goal is to become a proficient software engineer capable of creating innovative solutions to problems. I want to gain the best of knowledge possible and be of great impact to the world. My goal is to be better than where I started with Altschool and become the best beyond Altschool.</p>
